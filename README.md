# Poisonator

A lightweight World of Warcraft Classic addon designed to help rogues keep track of their weapon poisons and enchantments.

## Features

- **Poison Tracking**: Displays poison icons for main-hand and off-hand weapons at the top of your screen
- **Time Remaining**: Shows the remaining duration of your poison enchantments in MM:SS format
- **Charge Counter**: Displays the number of remaining charges for each weapon's poison
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically updates when you apply or remove poisons

## How It Works

Poisonator creates two small frames at the top-center of your screen, representing your main-hand and off-hand weapons:
- When a poison is applied, the poison icon becomes visible
- The timer counts down showing how long until the poison expires
- The charge counter shows how many hits remain before the poison wears off
- When no poison is active, the frames remain hidden

## Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Extract the `Poisonator` folder to your `World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns\` directory
3. Restart World of Warcraft or reload your UI (`/reload`)
4. The addon will automatically start tracking your poisons

## Usage

Once installed, Poisonator works automatically, no configuration needed. Simply play the game and apply your poisons as normal and the tracking interface will appear at the top of your screen.

## Requirements

- World of Warcraft Classic (tested with Interface version 11304)
- A sneaky rogue character (or any class using weapon enchantments, I suppose)
